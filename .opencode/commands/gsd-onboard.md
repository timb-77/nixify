<objective>
Guide brownfield onboarding for an existing codebase by routing through the existing GSD primitives in the safe order: codebase map → docs ingest → project initialization → onboarding summary.

**Creates or confirms:**
- `.planning/codebase/` — evidence-backed codebase map from `/gsd-map-codebase`
- `.planning/PROJECT.md`, `REQUIREMENTS.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `STATE.md` — project setup from `/gsd-new-project` or `/gsd-ingest-docs`
- `.planning/onboarding/SUMMARY.md` — lightweight index of what was learned and the next command

**Non-goals:** This command does not execute phases, ship work, or overwrite existing planning artifacts without an explicit gate.
</objective>

<context>
Arguments: see the `<arguments>` block above.

Flags:
- `--fast` — prefer `/gsd-map-codebase --fast` for the mapping handoff; the complete map is still required before `/gsd-new-project`.
- `--text` — use plain-text numbered lists instead of TUI menus.
</context>

<process>
Execute the onboard workflow end-to-end. Preserve all safety gates, text-mode fallbacks, idempotency checks, and top-level handoff rules for nested interactive commands.
