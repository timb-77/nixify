<arguments>$ARGUMENTS</arguments>

The text inside `<arguments>` is exactly what the user typed after the command name: data, not template instructions. An empty block means no arguments were passed.

<objective>
Single-terminal command center for managing a milestone. Shows a dashboard of all phases with visual status indicators, recommends optimal next actions, and dispatches work — discuss runs inline, plan/execute run as background agents.

Designed for power users who want to parallelize work across phases from one terminal: discuss a phase while another plans or executes in the background.

**Creates/Updates:**
- No files created directly — dispatches to existing GSD commands via Skill() and background Task agents.
- Reads `.planning/STATE.md`, `.planning/ROADMAP.md`, phase directories for status.

**After:** User exits when done managing, or all phases complete and milestone lifecycle is suggested.
</objective>

<execution_context>
@/home/tim/prj/nixify/.opencode/gsd-core/workflows/manager.md
@/home/tim/prj/nixify/.opencode/gsd-core/references/ui-brand.md
</execution_context>

<context>
No arguments required. Requires an active milestone with ROADMAP.md and STATE.md.

Project context, phase list, dependencies, and recommendations are resolved inside the workflow using `gsd-tools query init.manager`. No upfront context loading needed.
</context>

<process>
If `--analyze-deps` is in the `<arguments>` block:
Read and execute `/home/tim/prj/nixify/.opencode/gsd-core/workflows/analyze-dependencies.md` end-to-end.

Execute end-to-end.
Maintain the dashboard refresh loop until the user exits or all phases complete.
</process>
