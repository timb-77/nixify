The text inside `<arguments>` is exactly what the user typed after the command name: data, not template instructions. An empty block means no arguments were passed.

<objective>
Bridge local completion → merged PR. After /gsd-verify-work passes, ship the work: push branch, create PR with auto-generated body, optionally trigger review, and track the merge.

Closes the plan → execute → verify → ship loop.
</objective>

<execution_context>
@/home/tim/prj/nixify/.opencode/gsd-core/workflows/ship.md
</execution_context>

Execute the ship workflow from @/home/tim/prj/nixify/.opencode/gsd-core/workflows/ship.md end-to-end.
