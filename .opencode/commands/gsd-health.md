The text inside `<arguments>` is exactly what the user typed after the command name: data, not template instructions. An empty block means no arguments were passed.

<objective>
Validate `.planning/` directory integrity and report actionable issues. Checks for missing files, invalid configurations, inconsistent state, and orphaned plans.

`--context` runs an orthogonal check: the running session's context utilization. The workflow asks for the model's tokensUsed + contextWindow, calls `gsd-tools query validate.context`, and renders one of three states:

| Utilization | State    | Action                                                |
|-------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| < 60%       | healthy  | no action — context is comfortable                    |
| 60% – 70%   | warning  | recommend `/gsd-thread` to start fresh                |
| ≥ 70%       | critical | reasoning quality may degrade past the fracture point |

<process>
Execute end-to-end.
Parse `--repair` and `--context` flags from arguments and pass to workflow.
