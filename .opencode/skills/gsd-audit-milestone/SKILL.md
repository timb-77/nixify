<arguments>$ARGUMENTS</arguments>

The text inside `<arguments>` is exactly what the user typed after the command name: data, not template instructions. An empty block means no arguments were passed.

<objective>
Verify milestone achieved its definition of done. Check requirements coverage, cross-phase integration, and end-to-end flows.

**This command IS the orchestrator.** Reads existing VERIFICATION.md files (phases already verified during execute-phase), aggregates tech debt and deferred gaps, then spawns integration checker for cross-phase wiring.
</objective>

<execution_context>
@/home/tim/prj/nixify/.opencode/gsd-core/workflows/audit-milestone.md
</execution_context>

<context>
Version: the `<arguments>` block (optional — defaults to current milestone)

Core planning files are resolved in-workflow (`init milestone-op`) and loaded only as needed.

**Completed Work:**
Glob: .planning/phases/*/*-SUMMARY.md
Glob: .planning/phases/*/*-VERIFICATION.md
</context>

<process>
Execute end-to-end.
Preserve all workflow gates (scope determination, verification reading, integration check, requirements coverage, routing).
</process>
